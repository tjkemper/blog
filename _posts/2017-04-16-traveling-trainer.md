I have become a [traveling trainer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem), so to speak.

# Arizona

I ran a 10 week code bootcamp at [ASU](https://alumni.asu.edu/news/blog/cracking-career-code-revature-partners-asu-close-%E2%80%9Cit-skills-gap%E2%80%9D).

During my stay I visited the [Grand Canyon](https://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm).

My family hiked [Camelback Mountain](https://www.phoenix.gov/parks/trails/locations/camelback-mountain) twice.

### Hike 1

In addition to the bootcamp, I did a talk on DevOps, Jenkins, and AWS.

The ASU batch thanked me with gifts.

Had to see the Golden Gate Bridge while there.

# Missouri

Did a talk at Mizzou. Had the opportunity to meet a lot of the Computer Science faculty and students.

Also visited a heavy metal dive bar. We're the only ones wearing suits. Weird.

# Richmond

Currently running an 8 week coding bootcamp at Capital One.

Working on the same floor as [Yasmine Sadid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqi5o0zhJRE), who I trained last year. It's a small world.
