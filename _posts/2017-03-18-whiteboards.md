title:  "Whiteboards"

I recently finished conducting a bootcamp at ASU and I think I've found a new tradition: **Whiteboards**.

As a technical trainer, it's very easy to do all the wrong things:

* Read from PowerPoint in a monotone voice
* Talk *at* people
* Be boring as hell

I've done my best to inspire the people I teach. Code is an unbelievable
skill that let's you impact the world in a significant way. I think we *need*
more talented developers in the world and this is why I love my job. During my
years as a technical trainer, I've put together some commonsense ideas to
inspire and effectively teach difficult skills:

* Create a learning environment
* Encourage questions
* Hands on is better than theory
* Opinionated is better than generalized
* Direction is better than the answer
* Whiteboards are awesome

**Whiteboard time** is when each person gets 5 minutes to talk about whatever they want.
They are encouraged to use the whiteboard and typically discouraged from using a
projector, however there are exceptions.

I recently finished running a 10 week bootcamp at ASU, during which we did whiteboards
every day first thing in the morning. There were fortunate side effects of doing this,
such as people being more energetic after talking in front of others. However, there
were fundamental benefits we achieved from whiteboards:

* They certainly created a learning environment
* The batch was more engaged
* The batch became closer, faster
* They were so much fun and everyone learned a lot

There was no restriction on the topic of whiteboards. I think this was really important
for the successful introduction into our team. In the beginning, any new idea may
be met with resistance, but once the batch saw that whiteboards were a way of expressing
themselves, they owned it.

My personal goal was for them to talk about Java, AWS,
design patterns or anything that would further their understanding of the industry.
They certainly talked about these topics, and because it was on their own terms they
had a lot of fun doing it. It's really funny comparing the whiteboards of week 1 with
week 10. In the beginning, the whiteboards were short, really short. By week 10,
the batch was overstepping their 5 minutes, sometimes by a lot. But they were prepared,
energetic, and was too much fun to stop.

I should also note that many topics were
not about software engineering. We had topics ranging from genetics to special relativity
to military aircraft. I think this closely relates to one of my favorite quotes from Emerson:

> In my walks, every man I meet is my superior in some way, and in that I learn from him.

It's very important as a teacher to be humble and understand that people have knowledge
that you do not. Creating a learning environment to bring out this knowledge is very
important for every team and whiteboards is the best tool I've seen to accomplish this.
